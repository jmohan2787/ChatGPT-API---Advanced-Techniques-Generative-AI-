The final texture should be airy, almost like whipped cream. Add water tablespoon by tablespoon only if needed. Scrape down the sides of the blender periodically.\n",

            "    *   It looks bubbly and frothy on the surface.\n",

            "1.  **Check Batter Consistency:** After fermentation, gently stir the batter. **Do not whisk vigorously** or you will deflate the air bubbles. The batter should have a pouring consistency, similar to a thin pancake batter. If it’s too thick, add a few tablespoons of water and mix gently.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Heat the Pan (Tawa):** Place your tawa on medium-high heat. It needs to be properly hot. To check, sprinkle a few drops of water on it. If they sizzle and evaporate immediately, the tawa is ready.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Season the Pan:** Dip half an onion or a paper towel in a little oil and rub it all over the surface of the hot tawa. This seasons the pan and prevents the dosai from sticking.\n",
